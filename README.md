<br/>This website is to draw an auto path and save it in the database using HTML,CSS,javascript and PHP.<br/>
You can enter the value and press the buttons to draw on the canves.<br/>
After drawing the path you can save the path in the database or reset it.<br/>
To draw the path, javascript is used to implement changes based on clicked button with the desired magnitude.<br/><br/>
The shape of the Interface:<br/>
<br/> <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600"> <br/>
<br/>when inputting the magnitude and pressing the desired direction, a line with the same input appears.<br/>

<br/>example of clicking the button and drawing the line:<br/>
<br/> <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600"> <br/>
<br/> <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600"> <br/>
<br/> <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600"> <br/>
<br/>Final path was like this we named it and saved it<br/>
<br/> <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600"> <br/>
<br/>For the database ajax is used to reach to php and save it the data through php in the database.<br/>
The database table consists of direction id, the name of the direction, the magnitude and the name of the path.<br/>
